Registration Form:
This project is a simple HTML form for user registration. It includes basic validation checks and displays the submitted information upon successful registration.


Getting Started:
Download the Files: Download the project files, which should include an HTML file (index.html), a JavaScript file (script.js), and potentially a CSS file (style.css).
Open the HTML File: Open the downloaded index.html file in a web browser. This will launch the registration form.

Using the Form:
Fill out all the required fields in the form, including name, email, date of birth, gender, program of interest, address, phone number, mother's name, and father's name.
(Optional) Select a photo file to upload (if applicable).
Click the "Register" button to submit the form.

Functionality:
The form performs basic validation checks to ensure required fields are filled.
Upon successful submission, the form data is temporarily stored in the browser's session storage.
The submitted information is displayed on the same page for confirmation.

Note:
Data stored in session storage is temporary and will be lost when you close the browser window or tab.

The HTML file (index.html) defines the structure of the form and includes references to the JavaScript and CSS files (if applicable).
The JavaScript file (script.js) contains the validateForm() function responsible for form validation, data storage, and displaying submitted information.
The CSS file (style.css) (if included) provides styling for the form elements.
